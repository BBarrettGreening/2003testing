This repo contains the contents of our group project for COMP2003

---

## Design Documents
The design documents of our application, including UI prototypes and backend designs

---

## Minutes
This is a space for us to store the minutes from our client and sprint meetings to give us better insight into what the client wants and we need to develop

---

## SourceCode
This is where the code for our application is stored. For development this has been ran through Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ Idea but it will run in any environment with Node.js installed.

### Project Structure

### Setting Up Your Development Environment - Windows
#### Prerequisites:
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (this comes with npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

#### Steps to Set Up:
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Using either Git or GitHub desktop
https://github.com/https://github.com/Plymouth-University/comp2003-2024-group-10

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**  
   Open a terminal or Git Bash and run:
   ```bash
   cd comp2003-2024-group-10/SourceCode/
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use npm to install the necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**  
   Launch the Express server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`. Visit this address in your browser to interact with the frontend.
