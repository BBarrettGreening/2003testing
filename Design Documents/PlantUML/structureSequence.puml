actor "User" as User
participant "Web Interface" as UI
participant "Express Server" as Server
participant "Socket.io Server" as Socket
participant "getStructure.js" as StructureDetector
participant "Axios/Cheerio" as Parser
database "Theatre/Show Websites" as Websites
database "potentialSelectors.json" as PotentialSelectors
database "websiteConfigs.json/showWebsiteConfigs.json" as WebsiteConfigs

== Structure Detection Initialisation ==
User -> UI: Click "Find Structures" button
UI -> Server: POST /api/find-structure
Server -> StructureDetector: processStructureDetection(uploadedFile)
StructureDetector -> StructureDetector: Read uploaded XLSX data
StructureDetector -> PotentialSelectors: Load potential selectors
StructureDetector -> WebsiteConfigs: Load existing configurations

== Detection Process ==
loop For each website in XLSX file
    StructureDetector -> Socket: Log processing website
    Socket -> UI: Display current website being processed
    
    StructureDetector -> Parser: Make HTTP GET request
    Parser -> Websites: Fetch website HTML
    Websites --> Parser: HTML response
    Parser --> StructureDetector: Parsed HTML document
    
    StructureDetector -> StructureDetector: Test potential selectors against HTML
    
    alt Successful structure detection
        StructureDetector -> StructureDetector: Build selectors object
        StructureDetector -> WebsiteConfigs: Add/update website configuration
        StructureDetector -> Socket: Log successful detection
        Socket -> UI: Display success message
    else Failed structure detection
        StructureDetector -> StructureDetector: Add to failed structures list
        StructureDetector -> Socket: Log failure
        Socket -> UI: Display failure message
    end
end

== Complete Detection Process ==
StructureDetector -> Socket: Log detection completion
Socket -> UI: Display completion message
StructureDetector --> Server: Return detection results
Server --> UI: Send final structure detection results
UI --> User: Display successful and failed detections
