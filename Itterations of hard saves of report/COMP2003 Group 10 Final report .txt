Introduction - Jake Lear 
This report is used to outline the development timeline from start to finish, presenting how, as a group, we designed and implemented our solution. The product vision for Stagely is a
mobile application that gives users information about theatre shows, plays and musicals, it is to provide a tailored selection of productions based on factors like the users location, availability to travel and their preferences. From their personalised list of shows, the user is able to see details about the show, like its time, location and what it’s about, where they can then be taken to the booking link. 
Based on this, our project vision is to develop a scalable and adaptable web scraping application that runs off of the content management system for stagely. At the press of buttons, current and up to date data about shows; different locations and times, will be available via our various scraping modules that will scrape data about different theatres and what shows they have on; and shows with different locations and the playing group. Having a web scraping application will enable stagely to streamline the process of adding a show to their system, the information we are looking to extract at a minimum is show name, production name, location, dates shown and a link to the show listing. 
Ultimately, our goal is to take out the longevous hours of manually obtaining the information. 


The product provides:
* An intuitive and visually appealing interface that matches the house theme of the CMS
* A collapsable interface with a debugging interface that allows the user to see what's happening in the back end and track possible issues. 
* An XLSX import tool that can take a list of theatres or shows with IDs and static information so the scraper can attempt to find information about showings of the production.
* A step by step guide to help users do the following tasks 
   * Find the structure of the provided websites 
   * Scrape the productions 
   * Export the failed structures 
   * Download the scraped data as a CSV


The report will give a detailed insights into how the application has be developed through; project management and planning; design of the system aided by graphs and key parts of the code; quality assurance with surveys, questionnaires and testing and a conclusion, summarising the project, including achievements and issues. 


Client introduction - Open for work


Problem statement - Jake Lear
Without a web scraper, populating data like show information from theatre and show websites into the Stagely content management system (CMS) can be extremely time consuming, not only this, but can be inconsistent and vulnerable to human error. Due to the huge variation in the structure of theatre and show websites, a scraper made to deal with this will need to be dynamic to obtain details like the show name, location, dates and the link. The info must be formatted in a way that is uniform across all inputs and websites, from where it can then be sent to the stagely CMS.

Project planning material - Jake Lear
Project Overview
The goal of our project is to create a web scraping application that will take information about shows from all the theatre websites in the UK and push them to the Stagely CMS. The application will need to dynamically find the structure of these websites and extract the specific information Stagely wants to be on their CMS to streamline the process of adding a show to their system, the information we are looking to extract at a minimum is show name, production name, location, dates shown and a link to the show listing. 


Project Scope
Our web scraping application will be scraping information about theatre shows in the UK. The scope of this includes professional and amateur theatres, but we will not be scraping information from other venues such as stadiums and cinemas.
The application will only be pushing information to the Stagely CMS so any other services it could be considered to interact with are out of scope


Project Objectives 
* Dynamically read the structure of theatre websites to be scraped from
* Extract the relevant information from theatre websites and save it in an appropriate format
* Sort extracted information to only contain shows that are linked to a theatre production
* Sort information to be linked to a production as well as a theatre
* Push sorted information to the Stagely CMS to autofill fields streamlining the process of adding a show


Project Proposal

Communication plan
Across the team we will strive for clear, consistent, and efficient communication among team members and with the client throughout the project. We are and will continue to communicate in a combination of meeting calls, emails, reports and in person meetings, as these methods allow flexibility. Every other week we meet with the client and in the weeks that we don't meet the client, we have our scrum meeting where we can discuss progress and map the path for the near and far future. 
As a team we have been using discord to communicate between each other, allowing us to do video calls, share files, share code blocks and also develop together.
